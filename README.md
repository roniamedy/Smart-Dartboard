# 🎯 My-AutoDarts

A DIY attempt to build an automated dart scoring system using a simple webcam and Computer Vision. 

## Project Status: Work in Progress**

This is my first deep dive into **Python** and **Computer Vision**. The goal is to build a software that detects darts on a board and calculates the score automatically.

I am focusing on writing clean code and understanding the math behind image processing (Matrices, Perspective Warping).
